https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1 Started misbehaving 
And returning `'["https://nectardeco.cl/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MesaD.jpg"]'` as image URL and `hah2222` as title and returning only 10 products etc. So I found out that it's actually https://fakeapi.platzi.com/ and I am now running it on my own computer with public IP In a Docker container.
